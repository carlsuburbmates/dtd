# Operations and Observability

## Operator model

DTD has one non-technical operator. `/ops` is the single action and evidence surface. It should prioritise exceptions, explain impact and provide the smallest safe next action.

## Required operating picture

- Public posture and commercial gates.
- Trainer acquisition, review, publication and suppression state.
- Enquiry/matching cases and follow-up state.
- Message delivery failures, retries and fallbacks.
- Billing, trial, webhook, refund and reactivation exceptions.
- Suburb and sponsor inventory source/capacity.
- Background-loop last success/failure and authenticated schedule evidence.
- Recent immutable audit events.

## Action contract

An action shown in `/ops` must exist end to end. Mutating actions require:

1. authenticated and authorised API boundary;
2. explicit target and confirmation for consequential changes;
3. idempotency or safe duplicate handling;
4. persisted before/after or provider result;
5. audit event with actor, reason and timestamp;
6. notification or fallback where the affected user needs one;
7. truthful success/failure feedback in `/ops`.

Old specifications that list approve/reject/merge/delist/cancel/refund as available do not make those controls real. Implement the approved bounded action or remove the claim.

## Automation contract

Each loop exposes owner, cadence/trigger, input cohort, last run, last success, failure count, next action and retry/fallback. A deployed function without scheduling evidence is not an active automation. Repeated failures become an operator case rather than disappearing into logs.

## Financial safety

- Stripe mutations fail closed when live mode, permission or feature gate is absent.
- Refund execution remains disabled until live-payment, operator-confirmation, idempotency, inventory-release and audit paths pass production acceptance.
- Trial day-23 warnings run once per eligible provider-backed trial and persist outcome evidence.

## Observability

- API health includes dependency status without exposing secrets.
- Sentry must initialise in the process actually serving production requests before being called active.
- First-party attribution remains privacy-bounded and is not operational authority; Stripe and DTD persistence remain the sources of truth for monetisation reporting.
- Add charts only where they reduce operator effort; a second operator system is not allowed.

## Credential and provider resilience

The operator's browser session is an emergency recovery route, not an operating dependency. Runtime credentials and provider-management identities are separate, least-privileged managed secrets. No credential value belongs in source, local environment files, documentation or deployment literals.

- A rotation creates a replacement first, stores a new managed-secret version, verifies a no-traffic/canary or otherwise safe provider path, promotes it, observes it, then revokes the prior credential. Immediate revocation is reserved for active containment.
- The provider register records only sanitised operational metadata: provider/purpose, runtime or management scope, last verification, next expiry/review, degraded behaviour, independent alert route and recovery owner.
- `/ops` must surface a material provider's most recent verified status and failed/stale recovery cases. Health checks must not disclose secrets or become a public control plane.
- A provider integration is not accepted as autonomous until its runtime path, provider-management recovery path, safe verification and independent alert route have all been evidenced. If any is absent, it remains an explicit open finding.

## Environment isolation and staging sandbox contract

The system maintains strict isolation between live production and staging/sandbox environments:

- **Production Environment:**
  - Google Cloud Project: `gen-lang-client-0028123502`
  - Database: MongoDB Atlas cluster `DTD` (`dtd` database)
  - Purpose: Live dog owners, registered trainers, real Stripe subscriptions, and production domain (`dogtrainersdirectory.com.au`).
  - Access & Mutations: Zero-downtime rolling/canary deployments; strict production change control; gated commercial/refund activations.

- **Staging / Sandbox Environment:**
  - Google Cloud Project: `dogtrainersdirectory-dev`
  - Database: MongoDB Atlas cluster `dtd-sandbox` (`dtd_sandbox` database, AWS Sydney `ap-southeast-2`)
  - Purpose: Developer experimentation, AI-assisted development, feature testing, and automated build verification.
  - Guardrails: Stripe operates strictly in Test Mode (`sk_test_...`); transactional emails target dummy/test sinks; directory data is non-production; zero-cost idle state (serverless scale-to-zero).
  - Promotion Gate: Features, data migrations, or infrastructure changes must pass verification in the sandbox before promotion to production.
  - Deployment Automation: Executable via `bash scripts/deploy_sandbox.sh`. Automatically runs preflight code compilation, release gate checks, deploys `dtd-api-dev` with Secret Manager bindings, and verifies the `/api/health` endpoint against `dtd-sandbox`. Can be commanded on-demand by any AI assistant or run manually in shell.

## Operating cadence

- **Each session:** posture, failed/stale flows, work queue, message failures, billing/reactivation, inventory, recent changes.
- **Daily during launch:** resolve safety/identity/payment issues first; then delivery and supply exceptions.
- **Weekly:** review source health, catalogue/indexation drift, unresolved cases, provider costs and automation reliability.
- Refresh authenticated numbers before making an operational decision; never preserve a dated snapshot as live truth.
